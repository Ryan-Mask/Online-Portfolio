    <div>
        <p>
            With a degree in Mechanical Engineering, over a year of experience writing clean, full
            stack code for technical subject matter, and a highly developed artistic talent, I bring a well-rounded ability
            to turn technical needs into efficient code and an intuitive and aesthetic user experience. For example,
            this very website was coded from scratch and without a template by yours truly!

            Being an artist has developed my creativity, refined my attention for detail, and increased my patience. 
            While my drawings are realistic, I enjoy making simple graphics to capture complex ideas and I am currently
            learning Adobe Illustrator to practice and create such works. My artistic approach towards websites is minimilist
            with a desire to make software tools and technical matter pleasing to read and use.

                This project seeks to develop a removable attachment that can be inserted into a uniaxial Instron machine
                that will biaxially load a specimen. This device is important because biaxial machines are very expensive, and, 
                unlike Instron machines, quite uncommon.
                <br/><br/>
                This is my senior capstone project and has been beneficial in my growth as an engineer. This design is currently
                in the works but so far we (a team of 6 mechanical engineers) have completed almost the entire design life cycle. 
                We began with defining the needs and requirements of the design and deriving our parameters from that. Once we
                knew those, we began to develop concepts. Concepts from hydraulic application to a scissor lift type mechanism were
                considered, and ultimately the A-frame "Frankenstein" design shown to the left was chosen.
                <br/><br/>
                Extensive project management was required due to a limited budget and a very tight schedule on which to design
                and construct the device. This required the use of such common documents as a bill of materials (BOM) and 
                a Gantt chart, and requried thorough risk assesment and contigency planning in the face of the COVID pandamic.
                Additionally, in order to receive supplemental funding, it was required that 30 interviews
                be conducted to ensure a target market is available and willing to purchase the device.

                maps the strain field onto the specimen using special software. This design is currently being finalized and 
                construction/camera testing are set to begin mid-September.

                The small scissor lift was designed with the objective of carrying at least 9kg of weight while remaining
                as light as possible. The lift came with several constraints such as weight, build time, max deflection, min and max height,
                and how many parts could be 3D printed. <br/> <br/>
                This lift was built by a team of four engineers. The aluminum-6061 legs and lead screw were machined while the
                base and table were printed with a thermoplastic polymer. To ensure that the lift was as light as possible while
                able to carry the max load of 9kg, force and moment analyses were perfomed on the legs of the lift. <br/>
                <br/>
                The lift supported the 9kg load with a large factor of safety, had only 2mm of deflection, and was one of the
                lightest lifts constructed. However, it could only reach a maximum height of 193mm due to a last minute alteration.  
                In the future, a smaller factor of safety would be used to allow for lighter legs and any last minute alterations
                would be more heavily considered for their necessity to performance.

                The temperature controlled solar oven was designed to simulate a chicken egg incubator which could maintain
                a narrow temperature range of 99 - 102&#8457;. It is crucial that chicken eggs stay within this temperature 
                range for healthy chick growth. By using solar energy and a cost effective design, it is possible to reduce 
                the cost of chicken egg incubation. To accomplish this, an oven with the following features was designed:
                <br/><br/>
                <p>&#8226; Three removable mirrors</p>
                <p>&#8226; Microcontrolled cover </p>
                <p>&#8226; Glass top</p>
                <p>&#8226; Arduino microcontroller</p>
                <p>&#8226; Temperature sensor</p>
                <p>&#8226; Styrofoam and aluminum insulation</p>
                <br/>
                With these features it was possible to focus sunlight with the mirrors through the glass top to heat up the
                inside of the oven. The inside was fixed with a temp sensor that connected to an external microcontroller. 
                The temp sensor would trigger the microcontroller to open or close the cover, which would allow the oven 
                to heat up (if open) or cool down (if closed).
                <br/><br/>
                The initial design ran into setbacks, however, due to poor insulation and could only reach a max temperature of 
                about 85&#8457; as a result. To combat this, the mirror angles were adjusted to point more directly into the
                box; the inside was painted black and insulated with more styrofoam, which worked to both add insulation and 
                decrease the area being heated; and, finally, the temperature sensor was placed in direct sunlight to more accurately
                measure the temperature inside the oven.
                <br/><br/>
                Once the model was updated, the device was able to achieve its target temperature range of 99-102&#8457; 
                The new design was able to maintain a temp range of about 5&#8457;. More advanced designs would contain 
                an element which could retain excess heat for times when the sun is low. While this design wasn't perfect, it did provide
                a precedent for future solar incubators.

                My freshman year of college, I completed a semester-long project with a team of mechanical engineers. This 
                project sought to physically organize 100 marbles by size and color within 5 minutes using Matlab Lego Mindstorms 
                (Matlab code that controls various motors and sensors). The project did not go well as the team of 8 was highly
                unmotivated and left a large majority of the work to another teammate and myself. <br/> 
                <br/>
                This is not to pass any of the 
                blame from myself; I realized the team's disposition from almost the start but still waited to put forth the necessary effort.
                I also tend to take the lead in projects and in this case, while I did take an initiative role, I did not do so effectively.
                I organized tasks for my teammates and failed to assign them correctly or adequately motivate my teammates for their roles.
                <br/><br/>
                This led to my fellow motivated teammate and I working nonstop on the project for the final two weeks before 
                it was due. Although the project received a (gracious) passing grade, my spirit was broken as I felt the previous
                punishing two weeks had gone unappreciated.
                <br/><br/>
                I learned many valuable lessons from this project. First, that not-procrastinating is not the same as starting early.
                Doing your own work right when you need to leaves no room for error correction or helping the team. Second, when assuming 
                a leadership role, assume it genuinely and commit. Although I was self-appointed and, thus, reluctant to appear autocratic,
                I should have put more effort towards motivating and directing my team. 
                <br/><br/>
                Finally, (although this is not the first time I had
                experienced this), sometimes you fail because of your own lack of foresight and you must accept that you won't consider everything. 
                The room our project was tested in had different lighting than the room in which we calibrated the sensors, so the sensors worked 
                far less accurately. This issue had not been considered by my team and when it occurred it seemed painfully obvious.
